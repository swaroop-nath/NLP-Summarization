The summarization is carried out on a single-topic based extract of Wikipedia page on Sir Isaac Newton.


TF-IDF doesn't seem to be that necessary in single-document summarisation. Let's see how it can be utilised in multi-document summarisation.

Some features that can be used - 
Location of sentence in the document.
Length of the sentence (non-normalized).
Paragraph topic deviation, in which the sentence is located.
Does the sentence have words close to title/overall-topic

Nouns? And cohesion? (For later)
