His book <i><a href="/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="Philosophi� Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Philosophi� Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a></i> (<i>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</i>), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of <a href="/wiki/Classical_mechanics" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. Newton also made seminal contributions to <a href="/wiki/Optics" title="Optics">optics</a>, and shares credit with <a href="/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" title="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> for developing the infinitesimal <a href="/wiki/Calculus" title="Calculus">calculus</a>.
</p>
<p>In <i>Principia</i>, Newton formulated the <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion" title="Newton's laws of motion">laws of motion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation" title="Newton's law of universal gravitation">universal gravitation</a> that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a>. Newton used his mathematical description of <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> to prove <a href="/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion" title="Kepler's laws of planetary motion">Kepler's laws of planetary motion</a>, account for <a href="/wiki/Tide" title="Tide">tides</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Trajectory" title="Trajectory">trajectories</a> of <a href="/wiki/Comet" title="Comet">comets</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Axial_precession" title="Axial precession">precession of the equinoxes</a> and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the <a href="/wiki/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Heliocentrism" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentricity</a>. He demonstrated that the <a href="/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)" title="Dynamics (mechanics)">motion of objects</a> on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_object" title="Astronomical object">celestial bodies</a> could be accounted for by the <a href="/wiki/Celestial_mechanics" title="Celestial mechanics">same principles</a>. Newton's inference that the Earth is an <a href="/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids" title="Spheroid">oblate spheroid</a> was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis" title="Pierre Louis Maupertuis">Maupertuis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Marie_de_La_Condamine" title="Charles Marie de La Condamine">La Condamine</a>, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.
</p>
<p>Newton built the <a href="/wiki/Newtonian_telescope" title="Newtonian telescope">first practical reflecting telescope</a> and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a <a href="/wiki/Dispersive_prism" title="Dispersive prism">prism</a> separates <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum#Visible_radiation_(light)" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">white light</a> into the colours of the <a href="/wiki/Visible_spectrum" title="Visible spectrum">visible spectrum</a>. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book <i><a href="/wiki/Opticks" title="Opticks">Opticks</a></i>, published in 1704. He also formulated an <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling" title="Newton's law of cooling">empirical law of cooling</a>, made the first theoretical calculation of the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_sound" title="Speed of sound">speed of sound</a>, and introduced the notion of a <a href="/wiki/Newtonian_fluid" title="Newtonian fluid">Newtonian fluid</a>. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the <a href="/wiki/Binomial_theorem" title="Binomial theorem">binomial theorem</a> to non-integer exponents, developed <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_method" title="Newton's method">a method</a> for approximating the <a href="/wiki/Zero_of_a_function" title="Zero of a function">roots of a function</a>, and classified most of the <a href="/wiki/Cubic_plane_curve" title="Cubic plane curve">cubic plane curves</a>.
</p>
<p>Newton was a fellow of <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College</a> and the second <a href="/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics" title="Lucasian Professor of Mathematics">Lucasian Professor of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>.

Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of <a href="/wiki/Alchemy" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chronology_of_the_Bible" title="Chronology of the Bible">biblical chronology</a>, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the <a href="/wiki/Whigs_(British_political_party)" title="Whigs (British political party)">Whig party</a>, Newton served two brief terms as <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)">Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge</a>, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knighted</a> by <a href="/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain" title="Anne, Queen of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a> in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as <a href="/wiki/Warden_of_the_Mint" title="Warden of the Mint">Warden</a> (1696–1700) and <a href="/wiki/Master_of_the_Mint" title="Master of the Mint">Master</a> (1700–1727) of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mint" title="Royal Mint">Royal Mint</a>, as well as president of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> (1703–1727).

<p>Isaac Newton was born (according to the <a href="/wiki/Julian_calendar" title="Julian calendar">Julian calendar</a>, in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (<a href="/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates" title="Old Style and New Style dates">NS</a> 4 January 1643<sup id="cite_ref-OSNS_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OSNS-3">[a]</a></sup>) "an hour or two after midnight",<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[7]</a></sup> at <a href="/wiki/Woolsthorpe_Manor" title="Woolsthorpe Manor">Woolsthorpe Manor</a> in <a href="/wiki/Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth" title="Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth">Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Hamlet_(place)" title="Hamlet (place)">hamlet</a> in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. <a href="/wiki/Premature_birth" class="mw-redirect" title="Premature birth">Born prematurely</a>, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a <a href="/wiki/Quart" title="Quart">quart</a> mug.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[8]</a></sup> When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[9]</a></sup> Newton's mother had three children from her second marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWestfall198055_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall198055-11">[10]</a></sup>

<p>From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at <a href="/wiki/The_King%27s_School,_Grantham" title="The King's School, Grantham">The King's School, Grantham</a>, which taught Latin and Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup> He was removed from school, and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659.

<p>In June 1661, he was admitted to <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. He started as a <a href="/wiki/Subsizar" class="mw-redirect" title="Subsizar">subsizar</a>—paying his way by performing <a href="/wiki/Valet" title="Valet">valet</a>'s duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing him four more years until he could get his <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)" class="mw-redirect" title="Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)">MA</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWestfall198071,_103_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall198071,_103-16">[15]</a></sup> At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" title="René Descartes">Descartes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Astronomers" class="mw-redirect" title="Astronomers">astronomers</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Street" title="Thomas Street">Thomas Street</a>, through whom he learned of <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" title="Johannes Kepler">Kepler</a>'s work.

In 1665, he discovered the generalised <a href="/wiki/Binomial_theorem" title="Binomial theorem">binomial theorem</a> and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became <a href="/wiki/Calculus" title="Calculus">calculus</a>. Soon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the <a href="/wiki/Great_Plague_of_London" title="Great Plague of London">Great Plague</a>. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[16]</a></sup> Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on <a href="/wiki/Calculus" title="Calculus">calculus</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Optics" title="Optics">optics</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_gravitation" class="mw-redirect" title="Law of gravitation">law of gravitation</a>.

<p>In April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980178_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980178-20">[19]</a></sup> Fellows were required to become ordained priests, although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient.

<p>Newton later became involved in a dispute with <a href="/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" title="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz">Leibniz</a> over priority in the development of calculus (the <a href="/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy" title="Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy">Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy</a>).

Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Leibniz's notation and "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the <i>Principia</i> itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of "the method of first and last ratios"<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[25]</a></sup> and explained why he put his expositions in this form,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[26]</a></sup> remarking also that "hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles."<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Because of this, the <i>Principia</i> has been called "a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus" in modern times<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[28]</a></sup> and in Newton's time "nearly all of it is of this calculus."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[29]</a></sup> His use of methods involving "one or more orders of the infinitesimally small" is present in his <i>De motu corporum in gyrum</i> of 1684<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[30]</a></sup> and in his papers on motion "during the two decades preceding 1684".<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup>

</p>
<p>When Newton received his MA and became a Fellow of the "College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity" in 1667, he made the commitment that "I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7&nbsp;years] arrives, or I will resign from the college."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980179_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980179-38">[37]</a></sup> Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the <a href="/wiki/Thirty-nine_articles" class="mw-redirect" title="Thirty-nine articles">thirty-nine articles</a>, the basis of <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> doctrine.

<p>He was appointed <a href="/wiki/Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics" title="Lucasian Professor of Mathematics">Lucasian Professor of Mathematics</a> in 1669, on Barrow's recommendation.

Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_England" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument.

</p>
<p>In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a <a href="/wiki/Triangular_prism_(optics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Triangular prism (optics)">prism</a> in the position of <a href="/wiki/Minimum_deviation" title="Minimum deviation">minimum deviation</a> is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.<sup id="cite_ref-Whittaker_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whittaker-41">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[41]</a></sup> This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.
</p>
<p>From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[42]</a></sup> During this period he investigated the <a href="/wiki/Refraction" title="Refraction">refraction</a> of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a <a href="/wiki/Lens_(optics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Lens (optics)">lens</a> and a second prism.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBall1908324_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBall1908324-44">[43]</a></sup> Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to <a href="/wiki/Corpuscularianism" title="Corpuscularianism">corpuscular</a> alchemy.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves.

<p>From this work, he concluded that the lens of any <a href="/wiki/Refracting_telescope" title="Refracting telescope">refracting telescope</a> would suffer from the <a href="/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)" title="Dispersion (optics)">dispersion</a> of light into colours (<a href="/wiki/Chromatic_aberration" title="Chromatic aberration">chromatic aberration</a>). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the <a href="/wiki/Objective_(optics)" title="Objective (optics)">objective</a> to bypass that problem.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Early_Period_(1608–1672)_47-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Early_Period_(1608–1672)-47">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-White_1997,_p170_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-White_1997,_p170-48">[47]</a></sup> Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a <a href="/wiki/Newtonian_telescope" title="Newtonian telescope">Newtonian telescope</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-White_1997,_p170_48-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-White_1997,_p170-48">[47]</a></sup> involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique.

<p>Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the <a href="/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)" class="mw-redirect" title="Interference (wave propagation)">interference</a> patterns and the general phenomenon of <a href="/wiki/Diffraction" title="Diffraction">diffraction</a>. Today's <a href="/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Photons" class="mw-redirect" title="Photons">photons</a>, and the idea of <a href="/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality" title="Wave–particle duality">wave–particle duality</a> bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.
</p>
<p>In his <i>Hypothesis of Light</i> of 1675, Newton <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/posit" class="extiw" title="wikt:posit">posited</a> the existence of the <a href="/wiki/Luminiferous_aether" title="Luminiferous aether">ether</a> to transmit forces between particles.

</p>
<p>In 1704, Newton published <i><a href="/wiki/Opticks" title="Opticks">Opticks</a></i>, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another,&nbsp;... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"<sup id="cite_ref-Newton's_Alchemy_and_His_Theory_of_Matter_56-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Newton's_Alchemy_and_His_Theory_of_Matter-56">[55]</a></sup> Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional <a href="/wiki/Electrostatic_generator" title="Electrostatic generator">electrostatic generator</a>, using a glass globe.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[56]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>In his book <i>Opticks</i>, Newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays.<sup id="cite_ref-OPN1_58-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OPN1-58">[57]</a></sup> Some 278 years after Newton's discussion, <a href="/wiki/Beam_expander#Multiple-prism_beam_expanders" title="Beam expander">multiple-prism beam expanders</a> became central to the development of <a href="/wiki/Laser_linewidth" title="Laser linewidth">narrow-linewidth</a> <a href="/wiki/Tunable_laser" title="Tunable laser">tunable lasers</a>.

<p>Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)" title="Thomas Young (scientist)">Young</a> and <a href="/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel" title="Augustin-Jean Fresnel">Fresnel</a> combined Newton's particle theory with <a href="/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens" title="Christiaan Huygens">Huygens'</a> wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, <a href="/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe">Goethe</a>, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but "one hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour,&nbsp;... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by <a href="/wiki/John_Dollond" title="John Dollond">Dollond</a> to be wrong."<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[58]</a></sup>

<p>In 1679, Newton returned to his work on <a href="/wiki/Celestial_mechanics" title="Celestial mechanics">celestial mechanics</a> by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of <a href="/wiki/Planet" title="Planet">planets</a> with reference to <a href="/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws" class="mw-redirect" title="Kepler's laws">Kepler's laws</a> of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions.<sup id="cite_ref-hooke1679nov24_52-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hooke1679nov24-52">[51]</a></sup> Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with <a href="/wiki/John_Flamsteed" title="John Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980391–392_60-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWestfall1980391–392-60">[59]</a></sup> After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton communicated his results to <a href="/wiki/Edmond_Halley" title="Edmond Halley">Edmond Halley</a> and to the Royal Society in <i><a href="/wiki/De_motu_corporum_in_gyrum" title="De motu corporum in gyrum">De motu corporum in gyrum</a></i>, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[60]</a></sup> This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the <i>Principia</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Principia</a></i> was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from <a href="/wiki/Edmond_Halley" title="Edmond Halley">Edmond Halley</a>. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for <a href="/wiki/Classical_mechanics" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. They contributed to many advances during the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word <i>gravitas</i> (weight) for the effect that would become known as <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, and defined the law of <a href="/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation" title="Newton's law of universal gravitation">universal gravitation</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on <a href="/wiki/Boyle%27s_law" title="Boyle's law">Boyle's law</a>) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the <a href="/wiki/Lunar_theory#Newton" title="Lunar theory">irregularities in the motion of the Moon</a>, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p>
<p>Newton made clear his <a href="/wiki/Heliocentric" class="mw-redirect" title="Heliocentric">heliocentric</a> view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way, because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[61]</a></sup> For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line" (Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[62]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Newton's postulate of an invisible <a href="/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(physics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Action at a distance (physics)">force able to act over vast distances</a> led to him being criticised for introducing "<a href="/wiki/Occult" title="Occult">occult</a> agencies" into science.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[63]</a></sup> Later, in the second edition of the <i>Principia</i> (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding <a href="/wiki/General_Scholium" title="General Scholium">General Scholium</a>, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression <i>"hypotheses non-fingo"</i><sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[64]</a></sup>).
